<h1>An Exhibition</h1>

The walls were clean and white  
and had no opinion - the people  
were also, and made opinions  
to justify the silences: women  
murmuring among the frames,  
a balding man looking at them  
and very occasionally at the art.

The light was clean and white,  
and I didn't like it so I shoved  
myself into a corner with Käthe  
Kollwitz - see here it all begins  
to break down -  
I wanted to coat the world in charcoal -  
here is the world in charcoal  

pietas in the watery light  
of tenement windows -  
and this always next to the neat  
paved street  
the paved street that cuts a line in the earth  
from there to me and  
I stand in front of Käthe Kollwitz

and the bald man and the women chatter  
about charcoal right next to the  
Nazi propaganda posters which are  
red and clean and obscene.

I leave the room and find the street -  
a child's hand stiff with cold is in  
the hand of his grandfather.  
The two stand in the shifting traffic lights  
and together they sing in Yiddish  
of something forgotten,  
something far away from red letters  
and Michelangelo.
