<h4>Childhood</h4>

The floor: do you remember? Once you did;  
and all there was, were things that similarly  
insisted their solidity: the slope  
of sinks, the crooks of walls, the window panes.  
The world was what you pressed your forehead to.  
Outside, they start an argument – *money* –  
*the beer, you drink too much* – *you don’t* – *you can’t* –  
the same, the same, the ballad of anger  
and rain against the window pane. They come  
inside (the rain, of course), and up to you.  
Your ear is pressed to something – drainpipes thrum  
with water on the other side. They pull  
you into their arms. No – you want to say.  
The answer is there. Back there, back there –  
What is it? Something lost to drainpipes, somewhere.
