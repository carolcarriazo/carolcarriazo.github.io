<h1>The Rug-Beater</h1>

And there when the dawn is swelling  
still-blue on the backs of Brooklyn,  
I see her from a distance,  
beating her rug like an anachronism.  
The woman whacks the thing so deliberately,  
so stubbornly that I feel sorry for its  
shallow echoes on the balconies,  
too weak even to provoke an ironic audience.  
It is as natural as the hum of the refrigerator,  
but still it is a voice that remembers  
something else: foghorns and  
Ukrainian butchers. The birds now  
warble into the alleyway: soon, soon.  
The rug-beater looks up at the orange film  
on the horizon with a knowing look,

and it will all spill  
over the tops of the buildings,  
into windows and balconies,  
and this place will remember  
itself, and then it will start.
