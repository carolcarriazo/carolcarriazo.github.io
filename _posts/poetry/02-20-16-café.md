<h1>Café</h1>

What precipitous  
restraint! – that you should withdraw,  
‘by coincidence’,

to a missed corner  
just shy of the window-light.  
The coffee is myrrh,

it is too much. So.  
You pick salad with one point  
of a fork. But no –

The fork is so close  
to stabbing and the window  
is loud. If you rose – !

It is loud it is  
the siren call of the red  
tomato, it is 

the impossible  
girl sashaying by and past  
your tragic table.

For all this a glass  
of water, pushed a little  
further, is at last

a thick pool of light,  
dancing rich and violent  
in the window-light.
