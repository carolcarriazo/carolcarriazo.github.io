<h1>The Sleeper dreams of waking</h1>

I arrive  
	on the boulevards,  
		half-molted from sleep, 
	phrases –  
rising up and over me like madmen’s prayers
 
	they are not mine
 
as the wind blows over the sand dunes of winter I hope,  
	maybe  
		I had left myself  
	splayed out on an over-large bed  
warm and exhausted and free
 
	I wouldn’t want to wake me
 
I stop at the edge of a bridge – a hawk is  
	ripping into  
		what used to be a squirrel  
	now it’s a  
red gash in the earth
 
	only I see this

beside me,  
	young couples bent over the railing  
		murmur to their  
	reflections  
in the black incandescence of the water
 
	only the bird sees me

it pauses over its canvas and  
	flies away  
		how I wish I could  
	follow Caligari into that black, black sky,  
and watch the world dance under my wings.
 
	But I am Cesare – 

and still dreaming,  
		reach out  
to my earthly reminder  
	like half two lovers in the night
