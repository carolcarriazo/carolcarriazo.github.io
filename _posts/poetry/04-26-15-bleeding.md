<h1>Bleeding</h1>

The rising is lazy: beams of noonday sun, garish and unwanted, find a way past your fortress of dusty, drawn blinds and onto your face. The sheets are white and agitated, their creases casting shadows of a fitful sleep.  
Fine. You prop yourself up on one arm and bury your face one last time in your dreams. And in the rising - the rising for which you had so gathered your strength, that one Herculean effort of waking - suddenly, your nose is bleeding. The salty trickle quickly turns into a stream, and everything is red, you are everywhere…

You are four and have fallen off the bed. Your legs haven’t quite mastered that delicate maneuver of walking. Your face is smothered in a carpet of twine, and it hurts, get up get up get up get up get up and you push all the life energy in your frail body into those little arms. The colorless floor is inches from your face - then an inexplicable blossoming of red. It does not frighten you, it only fascinates you and you lie there for a while watching yourself drip into the carpet until it stops. Your parents find you prostrate in a small puddle like an artist who got carried away.

And now the sink and the mirror are splattered with blood, you are nineteen again and this isn’t stopping, God please stop, but it keeps coming, and you’re weak, you’re four and you’re nineteen and you’re everywhere  
You sink down into the cool tile floor as the stream abates and ceases. You want to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all but for now you can’t move. You can’t do anything but think about the rising, if one day

it’ll take so much  
out of you that you’ll just slip  
back into dreaming
