<h1>Sur l'Herbe</h1>

Is there such a thing as sun  
accidentally, that is  
some impromptu excursion

decided upon with a   
wave of the wrist,  
and settled finally in the grass

where you recline in a blue dress,  
oblivious and sun-drunk  
like a child?

Child, child, no child  
eats strawberries that slowly.  
The sun is glittering

off of the buildings, their facades  
too distant to distinguish but  
one of them is a church.

It cannot be otherwise;  
you are perfect and  
you smooth out the pleats

of your blue dress,  
waiting for someone to pin you,  
with fascistic eagerness,

to a canvas. What else is there?   
and where?  
Nothing: you, as thick as paint; *le d√©jeuner*.
