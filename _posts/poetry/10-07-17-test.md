**Childhood**
The floor: do you remember? Once you did;
and all there was, were things that similarly
insisted their solidity: the slope
of sinks, the crooks of walls, the window panes.
The world was what you pressed your forehead to.
Outside, they start an argument – _money_ –
_the beer, you drink too much_ – _you don’t_ – _you_ _can’t_ –
the same, the same, the ballad of anger
and rain against the window pane. They come
inside (the rain, of course), and up to you.
Your ear is pressed to something – drainpipes thrum
with water on the other side. They pull
you into their arms. _No_ – you want to say.
The answer is there. _Back there, back there_ –
What is it? Something lost to drainpipes, somewhere.
