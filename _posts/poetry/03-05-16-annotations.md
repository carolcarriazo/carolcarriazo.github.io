<h1>Annotations</h1>

Someone has written  
into my book: Grunebaum.

Where did you go to, Grunebaum,  
after lingering in the margins?

The answer to that  
was thicker once – but now

even you have forgotten.  
New York? Florida?

A twenty-year mortgage with   
a tree and an epitaph?

It will last a while,  
the epitaph –

but everywhere else  
you wrote in pencil.
