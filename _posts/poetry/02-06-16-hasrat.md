<h1>Hasrat</h1>

It is the promise of a red hum -  
of corners cut up by shadows,

and lazy sips of rum,  
and significant looks.

I confess it is a willing seduction -  
I look for the acrylic moments

when time beats out a heavy thrum;  
yes, I am won by the thrum

of my own heart. *Come,*  
*it says, find me in the rain,*

*in rooms that echo Chopin,  
or across the sea*

*under the distant sun-  
stained roofs of nowhere*

*in particular.* Now I have gone  
in search many times, crossed the sea

many times, and still the drum  
of my heart never alters,

beating out a song  
that never falters,

*And still I dream of lions,  
And still I dream of lions.*
