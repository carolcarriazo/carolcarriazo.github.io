<h1>Horatio’s Soliloquy</h1>

I have seen the neat arc;  
the brief gaieties, the  
commoner melancholies,  
the lust in a man's look  
when he plays God with a  
sword - I too have seen the

pangs of despised love, by every river  
a lover or an end, and every maid there  
drowned - I have seen it all from the  
squealing babe to the fallow field, dug up  
again for planting. You despair, you despair,  
my boy, of the harvest, but you'll go like a Roman  

to the grave. Look on 't, if   
you must, rake the skull for  
its every diseased alteration -  
love the name that marks you -  
rail against the sameness  
of the dead. But know,

while you yet have hot blood in your veins -  
they cannot take the rain  
on the path as we walk, the ink on your thumbs   
after an affliction of thought, the wine an after-thought,  
and as Alexander rots in changeless pages,  
you are immortal in the spaces.
