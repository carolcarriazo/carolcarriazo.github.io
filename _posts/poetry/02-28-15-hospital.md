<h1>The Hospital</h1>


*2005*

The door is open. It is leading  
into a garish hallway, immaculate and white.  
The rows of white doors are never ending.  
They look so dead in the light.

Each of them is a time lapse.  
It shelters its small tragedy from others.  
From everything else. A trap.  
The silence is so heavy it smothers.

By the doorway I see him trying to be strong, yet  
his shoulders slump with the weight of it all,  
face crumpled in sheets damp with sweat.  
I begin to think he’d fallen asleep, until

he searches for his daughter’s face  
in the tubes. She sleeps without fear.  
The only color in this place  
is here.

Her little body spasms. A low wail  
and the morphine takes her again. She will heal,  
and this drugged hell will pass. But he looks so pale.  
He’s breaking. I don’t know if he will.

I want to tell him that the scar is almost gone,  
that I’m not going to die,  
that I will forget and my life will go on.  
But I let him cry.
