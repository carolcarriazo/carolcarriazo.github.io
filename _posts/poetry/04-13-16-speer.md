<h1>To Albert Speer</h1>

*Salz ist mein Erbe*
        - Nelly Sachs

Your eagle has since fallen -  
it was almost beautiful then,  
high and glistening, a mirror

to the soft inferno. How impossible,  
that bruised-blood sky. It could have been  
the Apocalypse, or a Turner painting.  
                            All the while,  
soot filled the lungs of the city  
with a happy hysteria. The city flocked  
to your pagan idol and perched before it  
with heavy legs, unwilling  
to do anything else but die.

The damned blinded themselves in your cathedral of  
light: it reached out to the heavens with quiet perversity,  
unwitting imitation of the purest  
misplaced trust. All this, spear-headed  

by the unlikely priest, the starch-collared philosopher,  
immortal and faceless. Oh, these trials  
made a grotesque Caesar of your god,  
                        	didn't they?  
And when judgment day came,  
you were content to throw yourself into the hell  
of little white rooms, writhing with the guilt that  
your voluptuous death spiral ever made you feel    alive 

Now it's been long  
    since then. The last of the afternoon trickles golden  
through a few well-planted trees.  
The sidewalks on Wilhelmstrasse are paved,  
and the young, weightless,  
pass rows of neat buildings that stretch  
to each end of eternity.
