<h1>Squirrels</h1>

In the cold, thick springtime  
and viscous rain that paralyzes the will,

at the moment, “It is too quiet”  
is about to spill accusingly over

some lip, they flash their bellies.  
They chase each other round trees,

streaks of brown and white,  
and their bellies, round and white,

 – oh they must know  
what they ask.

Something quivers, darkens.  
It is too quiet.
