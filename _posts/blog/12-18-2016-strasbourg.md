&ensp; I went to Strasbourg today, for the first time. It's like Freiburg, just like Freiburg - Freiburg in a parallel universe. The signs were in French; but the cobblestone streets, the thick fog in winter that gives the sky a gray-slate color, and the familiarly Germanic cross-hatchings on the ancient houses are a reminder of just how close this place is to the border. It was lovely - too many people, maybe ('*capitale de NoÃ«l*'), but lovely. 

&ensp; In fact I have never been in so much of a hurry to get to someplace quiet, my room in this case. I sensed it as soon as I got on the return bus. I let the other girls in the group chat and I stared at the rain on the window, calmed, fascinated and saddened all at once by the reflection of the city lights in the droplets. Like some melting expressionist painting. Quieter. Then all of a sudden a heavy feeling in my chest - I hardly cry, but now I feel it rising, and suppress it - spontaneous sorrow.

&ensp; Anne-Sophie is a beautiful girl, and not unintelligent. Big doe eyes, hazel. Thick, thick hair. Full mouth, angular face, perfect teeth, thin and well-proportioned and elegant without fail. A stockings-dress kind of girl. But I can't reach her, and she can't reach me, as happens with most people - and after a short while she recognized it and stopped trying. Of course she sprinkled occasional words of appreciation, *it's so nice to finally talk with you*, things of this sort, but beyond this we were both pretty upfront with our lack of connection.

&ensp; And Veronika, wide-mouthed and voluptuous and beautiful in a raw brush strokes way, she has an edge to her. Studies medicine, clever. But somewhere in the middle of her is a big black hole. Libby tells me she's been through shit and I believe her.

&ensp; Libby, bless her. But there's still a glass pane there, I'm not able to completely let myself go. Eddie was like breathing. Libby's a darling, but still something there --

anyway. This is the sorrow: in a gray beautiful city, with people, but also unbearably lonely. Lonely, I hate the word, I deny it. On the bus ride home Victor is texting me about this girl he's probably going to marry but is still inexplicably broken off from and I want to yell in frustration. I adore him and I want to lose myself a bit and if his situation weren't so complicated, I might even want to fall a little bit in love. But even with him there's the glass (in the form of Noemi). Daniel, the sweet Irish boy, also has a girl. 

&ensp; And Jan: is proof that sex solves nothing. He is further from me than most of my friends. I'll break it off soon, I think.

&ensp; I'm surrounded by men I love but can't fall in love with. In these moments I think back to all the other unrequiteds, or never-will-bes, or what-ifs: Darko, Cian, Pavan.

&ensp; I need to go back to Strasbourg alone. In the spring. I can't breathe with these girls around, it's too much energy.
