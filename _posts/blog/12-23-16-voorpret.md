&ensp; Classes are over, my suitcase is packed, and I'm to see Patrick in Göttingen tomorrow. England is a few days away. I suppose I should be thankful to be yanked from my idleness and out of the flat, but even in idleness I find something to occupy me.

&ensp; Yesterday after waking up around two (hate myself for it - do it anyway), I fell into the black hole of Wikipedia, and somehow found my way to Napoleon - more specifically, to contemporary accounts of his physical appearance:

![napoleon](http://www.napoleon-series.org/images/research/napoleon/napoleonitaly.jpg)

>>"Had he not been so thin as to have a sickly air which was quite pitiful to see, one would have realized that he had unusually delicate features. The lines of his mouth in particular were full of charm."

>>"At first sight his face did not appear handsome, but the strongly pronounced features and ardent, scrutinizing eyes, combined with his sudden, impulsive movements, betokened a determined character, while his broad forehead declared the deep thinker."

>>"Bonaparte wore a simple coatee, close-fitting trousers, and boots reaching to the calf, trimmed with gold braid. His long hair was gathered in a pigtail. He was very thin and haggard; coughed often, as if he were consumptive, and was hollow-chested. He had a soft, weak voice....His speech was short and precise and uncommonly interesting. His eyes were mild and speaking, his tones pleasing, and his mouth full of expression.

>>"He was dressed in Blue with White waistcoat and Breeches. His Hat quite plain with a very small Cockade....The ease with which people of all sorts approached him sufficiently shew'd that He had no personal apprehension....I noticed that He picked is nose very much,--sometimes took Snuff, and would take off His Hat and wipe his forehead in a careless manner.-I also remarked that some of his Officers occasionally spoke to him, without His having addressed them, and seemed only to be making such remarks as persons who are on an easy footing do to each other....Here He stood abt. 3 yards from me abt. 10 minutes reading a paper....I noticed that all his actions were unstudied and quite & natural & calm....He looked me full in the face which gave me an opportunity to observe the colour of his eyes which are lighter, and more of a blue grey, than I should have expected from his complexion ["His complexion is not as I have heard it described waxy, but though wanting in colour sufficiently healthy."]....I thought there was something rather feverish than piercing in the expression of his eyes, but his general aspect was milder than I had before thought it....His person is below middle size. I do not think him more than 5 feet 6, I rather judge him to be less than that measure. Mr. [Benjamin] West [the famous painter] thinks otherwise. ["West thinks him 5 feet 7 inches high."] He is not what can be called thin. He is sufficiently full in the Shoulders and body & thighs for his age & height....[Samuel] Rogers [the poet] stood a little way from me and...seemed to be disappointed in the look of his Countenance and said it was that of a little Italian....[Farington observed that Napoleon] had no eye-brows, or eye-lash to give strong expression."

etc.

&ensp; Inevitably these personal recollections are bound to be biased towards the flatterers with the exception of the last quote from Joseph Farington (flipped through his diaries just now - they seem interesting in their own right for their descriptions of contemporary life à la Pepys). In any case I sometimes forget that these huge figures of the past were human at all. Imagine Napoleon, this great, controversial figure suddenly standing in my bedroom: really, a wisp of a man with only the strength of his personality and his eyes to recommend him. And Hitler - it's the same thing - people went on and on about his eyes. They were actors, in a sense.

&ensp; And, often, I notice that there's this tendency in people to subconsciously box away history as 'dead'. So long as humanity dictates our narratives of the past there is no reason to assume that the past was fundamentally different. People were still fucking and fighting; innovators were still just as rare, requiring the cast of mind to seize a salient opportunity without necessarily having the support of convention.

&ensp; Elon Musk is going to create a similar persona. He already is creating it. There are constantly accounts of his personal magnetism:

>>"Musk has managed to conjure up that Steve Jobs–like zeal among his troops. “His vision is so clear,” Singh said. 'He almost hypnotizes you. He gives you the crazy eye, and it’s like, yes, we can get to Mars.' Take that a bit further and you arrive at a pleasure-pain, sadomasochistic vibe that comes with working for Musk. Numerous people interviewed for this book decried the work hours, Musk’s blunt style, and his sometimes ludicrous expectations. Yet almost every person—even those who had been fired—still worshipped Musk and talked about him in terms usually reserved for superheroes or deities."

-- Ashlee Vance, *Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future* (2015)

&ensp; But it's funny. Even he is tied to his face. We're all just tied to our bodies.

&ensp; Had a chat with Victor yesterday over coffee. What an interesting person. Thin as a rail, it's like his mind is burning through his body. Eyes darting off to one side in thought while he composes himself in conversation. We spoke about learning; work; idleness. He lives in his ideas, reads, tries to assert himself, but I can see it: he's confused. Of course he's confused; he's 20, and he's trying to understand the world all at once, generalize it, bring it to fundamental principles. I relate to his struggle. As he said himself, there is, in him, that Catholic undercurrent of self-doubt and supreme underconfidence. Funny that it should be there alongside a steely cynicism, callousness, and even a certain cruelness, that comes with being such a detached ideologue. (Voltaire?) Still, inevitably he has blood in his veins, and interacts with the world like every other person.
