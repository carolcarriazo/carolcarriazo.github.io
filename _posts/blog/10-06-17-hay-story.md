I pissed myself on the way in here.

It’s one in the morning and I was on the road from Keefe, shuffling my absurdly pink strawberry milkshake between my reluctantly pink hands. It was too cold, too sweet, and too pink, and perfect, like a giant cup of Pepto-Bismol. I don’t recall Pepto-Bismol too well from my childhood, but I suppose it exists in the set of things containing collective nostalgia.

Anyway my bladder was creeping up on me, as it sometimes does. By the time I fumbled my key into the door I was rocking back and forth like an autistic child. WIth my backpack on and everything I decided the most sensible thing to do was to plop myself down in the middle of a sufficiently vacant floor-space and give up.

There’s a sublime pleasure in wetting oneself. It’s so warm. It’s almost a shame more people don’t get to experience it at this age. I at least have an excuse, vis-á-vis extreme urinary incontinence.

But never mind about urine, let me tell you a story.

———

“Come on, try,” she says. My sister is trying to teach me how to make a joke.

 My sister is nine years older than me, and I am four. (I may not be four, but I am certainly somewhere in between three and five, and I think four is an appropriate amount of sentience for the me in this story.)
 
Five minutes earlier she had walked me through “Why did the chicken cross the road?” in many variations, but humor was something that apparently still eluded me.

“Try!” she demanded, joking of course, but the threat was very real to me as she shook her can of Coca-Cola in my general direction. She smirked. I still don’t know what she would have done with it, but forgive me; I was very small. 

I summoned all my knowledge of farm animals for the trial at hand. 

“—Why did the chicken cross the road?” I began, feebly.

“Why?” she asked, still smirking.

“To get some hay,” I said, very blandly.

At that  moment my sister was mid-sip and chortled in a fit of hysterical laughter. As she threw her head forward to mop up the brown liquid running down her chin, her blue-green bangs fell into her face. (For some reason the whole scene to me now feels very dated, as if that chortle, that can of soda and those bangs on that pale girl couldn’t have happened anytime after 1999.)

“To get some _heeeyyy_!” My sister repeated, incredulous. “To get some _heeeyyy_!”

I was pleased with the reaction I had produced. I ran around the  house yelling, half at my parents.

“Why did the chicken cross the road? To get some *heeyyy*!" 

"*HEEEYYY*!”
