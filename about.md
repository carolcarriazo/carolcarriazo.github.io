I'm a person called Carol, roughly 20 years old. This is my bit of internet. 

I found that a regular journal didn't do much for my writing productivity, for the simple reason that its organizational abilities weren't very elastic; there was no good way to partition my personal journaling from unrelated thoughts or interesting material that I would pick up while living. A website allows me that elasticity and enables me to bring otherwise disjointed bits of information together in one central repository.

should you for any reason like to contact me, here is my
